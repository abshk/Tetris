Tetris
======

A game of Tetris I developed using Java. This game takes input from mouse. 

      Scroll Up (wheel): Block rotates anticlockwise.
      Scroll Down (wheel): Block rotates clockwise.
      Push Left button: Block moves left laterally.
      Push Right button: Block moves right laterally.
      Mouse cursor in the main rectangular gaming area: Game pauses.
      Mouse cursor inside the falling block: Current block changes to Next block (displayed in the small rectangle on top right).
      Horizontal lines disappear automatically once they are complete.
      The game concludes when a block hits the top edge on the main gaming area.
      Quit button can be used to exit the game.



At the start, the program will ask for four parameter values before the game starts in standard input (console).

      Scoring Facor (an int): This is the rate of score change with each level ascension.
      Numbers of rows in each level (an int): The number of rows that need to be completed to graduate to next level.
      Speed factor (a float): The rate of change of speed with each level ascension.
      Size of a unit (int, either "2" or "4" or "8"): The size of a unit. The smaller the size, the more space on main gaming area.

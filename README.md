Tetris
======

A game of Tetris I developed using Java.


At the start, the program will ask for four parameter values before the game starts in standard input (console).

      Scoring Facor (an int): This is the rate of score change with each level ascension.
      Numbers of rows in each level (an int): The number of rows that need to be completed to graduate to next level.
      Speed factor (a float): The rate of change of speed with each level ascension.
      Size of a unit (int, either "2" or "4" or "8"): The size of a unit. The smaller the size, the more space on main gaming area.
